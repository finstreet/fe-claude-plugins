# Page translations

## General translations

The structure for pages is pretty simple. Portal pages will just have a title and Inquiry Pages will have a title and a description.

Follow the general-information structure and afterwards add the following keys / translations:

```json
{
    "title": "",
    "description": "" // <-- add description where applicable
}
```
